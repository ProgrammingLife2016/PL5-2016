## Notes
Sprint
Definition: 7
-With 'improve' or 'fix', define what should be fixed or improved
-How can you define hours for a problem when you don't know what the problem is? There should be some elaboration on this for the hours chosen and what happens when you input more or less hours.

Splitting: 7
-Amount of hours differ quite a bit per person

Responsibility: 7
-Shifted way more towards Kasper and Matthijs

Reflection
Reflection: 3
-'focused on more pressing issues' What kind of issues? (should define a problem for this)
-Reactions to problems should define how this will not happen again in the future. 
-The reflection should make clear why tasks are not done or why there have been changes, which it does not at the moment 

Estimation: 7

Priority: 10

Architecture
Changes: 9
Document: 9
-Document still has same feedback (backend has too many responsibilities)
-fix typos and such
-Long list of objects in tagcwebapp

CQ: 7
-Unused code should be deleted
-No instantiations outside of the constructor
-Design pattern can improve webapp/backend communication

Readability
Formatting: 7
Naming: 10
Comments: 9 
-Keep comments in javadoc (no //comments)
-Sometimes huge functions found

CI
Building: 10
Testing: 8
-Some important parts not tested

Tooling: 9
-Either fix errors or ignore them in the config

PBD
Branching: 10
Code Review: 9
-Always reply after a fix (with a lgtm for example)

## Announcements
We will not have the regular SE Meeting next Friday because of the Serial Meetings we will have with Bacchelli. You will need to prepare a 10-15 minute demo and sell your product. 
 
Besides that please fill in this survey for your feedback on me [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eprgikpJsNbVj6x0CDLeKqxsdnkfd1P9k9Qdn8kkqr8/viewform#start=openform)
