## Notes
sprint:
-definition: concrete tasks + better specification (give colour to genomes)
-splitting: here and there big difference
-responsibility: a bit shifted for some people

reflection: 
-estimation: not accurate

EAD:
-only HD space @scalability?
-Use design goals in your subsystem choices, why is this a good choice?

EAD-Changes:
-Should split back-end in modules
-Structure of back-end should be better described in EAD

CQ:
-Roughly same as last week
