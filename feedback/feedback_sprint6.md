## Notes
Sprint
Definition: 8

- Collapsing and giving a heatmap seem like two different points
- What are the SIG points? (should be defined in different points)

Splitting: 8

- 24 hours on SIG improvements?? And this is Kasper's only task

Responsibility: 8

- Bit shifted overall

Reflection
Overall: check spelling
Estimation: 3

- All these tasks different amount of hours allocated, no explanation

Prioritisation: 8

Reflection: 1

- There is no reflection

Code Evolution
Architecture
Changes: 9
Document: 8

- No new version
- Feedback should be implemented

CQ: 9

Code Readability
Formatting: 9
Naming: 10
Comments: 9

- Some outdated comments

CI
Building: 9
Testing: 9

Tooling: 4

- Findbugs, PMD and Checkstyle have errors
- Should be done per PR at this stage

PBD
Branching: 9
Code Review: 7

- cache branche outdated
- Quality of code review differs. Sometimes there are comments, and afterwards the PR is merged without any changes
