# Feedback PL5 Totally Awesome Genome Coders

Sorry for the late feedback, there was some confusion as to how to and when to send the rubrics to you guys. Below you will find the rubrics for sprint 1.

Note: The Code Evolution Quality part does not count this week. 

A brief explanation for the low grades: Your architecture design contained close to no information as to what it should contain. Please check the template on BB. Code should contain more commenting (everything should be commented). Also, I could not get Maven to work. You should contact me if this is my fault or if it hasn't been set up properly.

Comments on the Architecture Design document will be there Monday.

If you have any questions, please ask them tonight, as I will be away until Monday.
